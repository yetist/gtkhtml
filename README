What is GtkHTML?
----------------

GtkHTML is a lightweight HTML rendering/printing/editing engine.  It
was originally based on KHTMLW, part of the KDE project, but is now
being developed independently.

Mailing list
------------

GtkHTML is currently maintained by the Evolution team and no longer
has its own mailing list.  The best place to ask GtkHTML questions
is on the "evolution-hackers" mailing list.

You can subscribe to this list at:

        http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/evolution-hackers

You can also report GtkHTML bugs by filing a report at:

        http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=GtkHtml

NOTICE: While GtkHTML is still being maintained, it is no longer being
        actively developed and is not recommended for new applications.
        Consider WebKit/GTK+ or Gecko instead.

Requirements
------------

In order to compile GtkHTML, you need:
       gail >= 1.1
       GTK+ >= 2.16
       enchant >= 2.2.0
       iso-codes >= 0.49
       gnome-icon-theme >= 2.22

If you want to try the test program `testgtkhtml', you also need
libsoup-2.4 or later.

To try it out, run testgtkhtml in the source directory, i.e:

    cd gtkhtml
    ./testgtkhtml

WARNING: testgtkhtml's URL fetching code is very buggy.

You can also test GtkHTML's simple HTML editor widget:

    cd components/editor
    ./gtkhtml-editor-test

The editor widget is used in Evolution's mail composer.
